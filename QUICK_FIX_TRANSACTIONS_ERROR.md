# Quick Fix: databases.createTransaction is not a function

## Error You're Seeing

```
E  Atomic booking failed: databases.createTransaction is not a function (code: BOOKING_ERROR)
```

## Root Cause

Your `node-appwrite` SDK version doesn't support native transactions yet. Version 14.1.0 doesn't have the `createTransaction` method.

## Solution (Choose One)

### Option A: Update SDK to Support Transactions (Recommended)

**1. Update package.json**

I've already updated it to:
```json
"dependencies": {
  "node-appwrite": "^16.0.0"
}
```

**2. Install dependencies**

In your terminal:
```bash
cd Functions_Appwrite
npm install
```

**3. Verify the update**

```bash
npm list node-appwrite
```

Should show: `node-appwrite@16.x.x` (or higher)

**4. Redeploy the function**

Via Appwrite Console:
- Go to Functions ‚Üí bookTicketAtomic
- Upload the updated code
- Make sure Runtime is **Node.js 18+** (or Node.js 21)
- Deploy

Via CLI:
```bash
appwrite functions updateDeployment \
  --functionId bookTicketAtomic \
  --entrypoint "src/bookTicketAtomic.js" \
  --code "."
```

**5. Test**

Try booking a ticket again. Check logs for:
```
‚úÖ Transaction created successfully: { transactionId: 'txn_...' }
```

---

### Option B: Use Fallback Version (Works with Any SDK Version)

If Option A doesn't work or you can't upgrade, use the fallback version:

**1. Replace the function file**

Rename/use `bookTicketAtomic_v2.js` instead:

```bash
cd Functions_Appwrite/src
cp bookTicketAtomic_v2.js bookTicketAtomic.js
```

**2. Redeploy**

The v2 file automatically detects if transactions are supported:
- ‚úÖ If YES: Uses native transactions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è If NO: Falls back to optimistic locking with manual cleanup

**3. Check logs**

You'll see either:
```
‚úÖ Transactions supported: true
```
or
```
‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Transactions not supported in this SDK version. Using optimistic locking fallback.
```

---

## Verify Transaction Support Locally

Run this test before deploying:

```bash
cd Functions_Appwrite
node test_transactions.js
```

This will tell you:
- ‚úÖ SDK version
- ‚úÖ Which methods are available
- ‚úÖ If transactions are supported

---

## Quick Test Command

After deploying, test with:

```bash
# From your Android app or Postman
POST https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1/functions/{functionId}/executions
Headers:
  Content-Type: application/json
  X-Appwrite-Project: YOUR_PROJECT_ID
  X-Appwrite-Key: YOUR_API_KEY

Body:
{
  "userId": "test_user",
  "eventId": "event_123",
  "eventName": "Test Event",
  "eventSubName": "Test",
  "eventDate": "2025-12-31",
  "eventTime": "18:00",
  "eventLocation": "Test Venue",
  "totalAmountPaid": "100",
  "pricePerTicket": "50",
  "imageFileId": "img_123",
  "category": "VIP:Rs.50",
  "quantity": "2",
  "paymentId": "pay_test_123",
  "subtotal": "100",
  "taxGST": "0",
  "internetHandlingFee": "0",
  "ticketTypeName": "VIP",
  "qrCodeFileId": null
}
```

---

## Expected Behavior

### With Transactions (SDK v16+):
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "ticketId": "ticket_abc123",
    "transactionId": "txn_def456",
    "orderId": "order_ghi789",
    "message": "Ticket booking completed successfully with Appwrite Transactions"
  }
}
```

### With Fallback (SDK < v16):
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "ticketId": "ticket_abc123",
    "transactionId": "txn_def456",
    "orderId": "order_ghi789",
    "message": "Ticket booking completed successfully (optimistic locking)"
  }
}
```

---

## What If It Still Doesn't Work?

### Check 1: SDK is actually updated

```bash
cat Functions_Appwrite/node_modules/node-appwrite/package.json | grep version
```

Should show 16.0.0 or higher.

### Check 2: Function runtime

In Appwrite Console ‚Üí Functions ‚Üí Settings:
- Runtime should be **Node.js 18** or **Node.js 21**
- NOT Node.js 16 or lower

### Check 3: Appwrite Server Version

Your Appwrite server needs to be version 1.0+ for transactions.

Check in Console ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí About

### Check 4: Try the fallback version

Use `bookTicketAtomic_v2.js` which works with ANY SDK version.

---

## Summary

**Immediate Action:**

1. ‚úÖ I've updated `package.json` to use `node-appwrite@^16.0.0`
2. üîÑ YOU: Run `npm install` in `Functions_Appwrite/`
3. üîÑ YOU: Redeploy the function with Node.js 18+ runtime
4. ‚úÖ Test booking again

**Alternative:**

- Use `bookTicketAtomic_v2.js` which has auto-fallback

**Questions?**

- Check function logs in Appwrite Console
- Run `node test_transactions.js` to verify support
- Ensure Appwrite server is version 1.0+
